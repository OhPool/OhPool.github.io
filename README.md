##Opal Client info

#Chromium 

The client itself is based off un-googled chromium which is practically an open source version of chrome!
This in itself is from an unoffical binary provided by the un-googled software team which you can find here -> https://tinyurl.com/56968dau

#Extensions

The opal client install comes bundled with these extensions:

Chromium WebStore - https://tinyurl.com/m7cvs29y
Gama's (amazing!) community patch - https://tinyurl.com/4zpp8hfj
Faster web - https://tinyurl.com/39nmxz3k
Ublock origin - https://tinyurl.com/4hcbphy2
Phantom wallet - https://tinyurl.com/2z5cpmkh

If you are super concerned about security (or just want to add your own extensions) you can add your own extensions using this guide -> https://tinyurl.com/4h654t3n

I'm concerned about y'alls privacy and crypto funds so I wouldn't supply cracked extensions,they are all up to date as of client release and are personally cleared by me, but I still wanted to mention it anyway (and if you use a diff wallet its useful!).

#Chromium switches

You can change the chromium switches used by adding/changing the switches.txt file, even more configuration!
You can find an entire list here - https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/
